# User Deletion Fix - September 17, 2025

## Issue Identified
After deleting users (students, teachers, parents) from the admin panel, they were still showing in the user list.

## Root Cause
The `deleteUser` and `deactivateUser` functions in `src/firebase/auth.js` were trying to delete from collections named after the user type ("students", "teachers", "parents"), but all users are actually stored in a single `users` collection with a `role` field.

## Fixes Applied

### 1. Fixed Collection References
**File**: `src/firebase/auth.js`

**Before**:
```javascript
const userDoc = doc(db, userType, userId); // userType = "students", "teachers", "parents"
```

**After**:
```javascript
const userDoc = doc(db, 'users', userId); // All users are in 'users' collection
```

### 2. Enhanced Logging
Added console logs to track deletion process:
- `🗑️ Deleting user ${userId} from users collection...`
- `✅ User ${userId} deleted successfully from Firestore`
- `🔒 Deactivating user ${userId} in users collection...`
- `✅ User ${userId} deactivated successfully in Firestore`

### 3. Database Structure Clarification
All users are stored in the `users` collection with:
```javascript
{
  id: "userId",
  role: "student" | "teacher" | "parent",
  name: "User Name",
  email: "user@email.com",
  // ... other fields
}
```

## Testing Steps
1. Navigate to Admin Dashboard
2. Try deleting a user (student, teacher, or parent)
3. Check browser console for deletion logs
4. Verify user is removed from the list immediately
5. Refresh page to confirm deletion persisted

## Expected Behavior After Fix
- ✅ Users are properly deleted from Firestore
- ✅ Admin list updates immediately after deletion
- ✅ Console shows successful deletion logs
- ✅ Users remain deleted after page refresh
- ✅ Error messages are clear if deletion fails

## Files Modified
- `src/firebase/auth.js` - Fixed `deleteUser` and `deactivateUser` functions
