## 🚀 How to Use

### For New Users:

2. **Click "Register as Student"** or select "Teacher" and register
3. **Fill the registration form** with your details
4. **After successful registration**, you'll be redirected to login
5. **Login with your credentials** - you'll be taken to your respective dashboard

### For Teachers:

- Create and manage attendance records
- View student attendance data

### For Students:

## 🔧 Firebase Setup Required

Make sure your `.env` file has the correct Firebase credentials:

```env
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_api_key

REACT_APP_FIREBASE_STORAGE_BUCKET=your_storage_bucket
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_MESSAGING_SENDER_ID=your_messaging_sender_id
REACT_APP_FIREBASE_APP_ID=your_app_id
```

## 📱 Current Flow

1. **App loads** → Login page appears
2. **New user clicks register** → Registration form
3. **User registers successfully** → Redirected to login
4. **User logs in** → Appropriate dashboard loads based on role
5. **User interacts with dashboard** → Real-time data from Firebase
6. **User logs out** → Returns to login page
