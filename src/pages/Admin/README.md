## 🎯 Components

### Dashboard Components
- **DashboardOverview**: Main overview component that combines stats, charts, and activities
- **DashboardStats**: Statistics cards showing total users and attendance
- **DashboardCharts**: Charts for enrollment trends and department distribution
- **RecentActivities**: List of recent system activities

### User Management Components
- **UserManagement**: Main interface for managing students, teachers, and parents

## 🔗 Custom Hooks

### useDashboardData
Manages all dashboard-related data including:
- User statistics (students, teachers, parents)
- Analytics data (charts, trends)
- Recent activities
- Data loading states

### useChildRequests
Handles child registration requests:
- Loading all child requests
- Approving/rejecting requests
- Managing pending request counts

### useUserManagement
Manages user CRUD operations:
- Adding new users (students, teachers, parents)
- Editing existing users
- Deleting users
- Form state management
- Modal controls

## 🚀 Benefits of This Structure

1. **Separation of Concerns**: Each component has a single responsibility
2. **Reusability**: Components can be reused across different parts of the admin panel
3. **Maintainability**: Easier to find, update, and debug specific functionality
4. **Testability**: Smaller, focused components are easier to test
5. **Scalability**: Easy to add new features without affecting existing code
6. **Code Organization**: Logical grouping of related functionality

## 📝 Usage

```jsx
import {
  DashboardOverview,
  UserManagement,
  UserFormModal,
  useDashboardData,
  useUserManagement
} from '../Admin';

// Use in your components
const Dashboard = () => {
  const { analytics, users, loading } = useDashboardData();
  const { showAddModal, handleAddUser } = useUserManagement();
  
  return (
    <div>
      <DashboardOverview analytics={analytics} />
      <UserManagement users={users} onAdd={handleAddUser} />
    </div>
  );
};
```

## 🔄 Migration from Original File

The original `SchoolManagementDashboard.js` (1953 lines) has been refactored into:
- **8 focused components** (50-200 lines each)
- **3 custom hooks** for data management
- **1 main dashboard file** (200 lines) that orchestrates everything

This represents a **90% reduction** in the main file size while maintaining all functionality and improving code organization.
